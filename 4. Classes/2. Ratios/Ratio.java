    // and denominator.

    // Note that these look like local variables in a method, except we
    // add the qualifier "private" to indicate that no one except the
    // methods of this class can access these variables.  This is the
    // most common qualifier for instance variables.

    // methods we write within this class.

    // We next provide the methods that operate on a Ratio.  The first is usually
    // a special method that gets called when we create a Ratio, called the
    // constructor.  It looks like the method calls we have seen earlier in
    // the semester, except we do not need "static" or "void".  The name of
    // the constructor must match the name of the class, and it should take
    // any parameters needed to give the class its initial value.

        // this case, we initialize them based entirely on the parameters.

        // or may use more complex expressions.  Note that "num" and "den" are
        // parameters whose scope is only this constructor -- they will not 
        // exist when we get to other methods later on.  While "numerator"

    // modifying the "private" instance variables based on the values in the
    // parameters.  Mutator methods modify the state of an object, but do
    // not usually return any information, so they are specified with a "void"
    // qualifier in addition to "public".  Note that we do not specify "static"
    // on any of our methods in the class now that we are defining our own

    // the private instance variables within the class describing our object.
    // We start with 2 simple accessors -- ones that allow us to retrieve the
    // numerator and denominator.  Since those are both integer values, we specify
    // "int" return values on our methods.

    // representation of each instance of the class.  It is always in a
    // method named toString that returns a String.  If we do not provide
    // such a method, Java will use a builtin one (which will work but
    // which probably does not do quite what we'd like).  So we provide one
    // here to print out our Ratio in a "nice" format.
